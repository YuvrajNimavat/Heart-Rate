<h1>Heart Rate Monitor App 💓📱</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
The Heart Rate Monitor App is a mobile application that allows users to measure their heart rate using their smartphone's camera and LED flash. By simply placing a finger over the camera, the app tracks the subtle changes in skin color caused by blood circulation, providing an accurate heart rate reading in beats per minute (BPM). Whether you are tracking your fitness, monitoring your health, or just curious, this app provides a simple and efficient way to measure your heart rate on the go.

<h3>Features 🔥</h3>
💓 Real-time Heart Rate Detection: Measure your heart rate in real time by using the camera and flash.
🎨 User-Friendly Interface: Clean, modern design makes the app easy to navigate and use.

<h3>How It Works 🤔</h3>
The app uses the camera to detect changes in the user's fingertip caused by blood flow. The flash provides constant lighting to capture subtle color variations. Based on these changes, the app calculates your heart rate in BPM (beats per minute). The results are displayed on-screen in real time.
